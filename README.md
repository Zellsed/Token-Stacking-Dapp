# Token Stacking Dapp

Token Stacking Dapp is a personal project where users can lock (stake) their tokens and earn rewards over time. The decentralized application (Dapp) is built to provide a simple, transparent, and secure way for users to participate in token stacking.

The project focuses on building an easy-to-use interface, ensuring smart contract safety, and offering real-time updates on staking balances and rewards.

Technologies used include Solidity for smart contracts, React for the frontend, and Ethereum blockchain for deployment.
